# Assistive-Real-time-Yarn-for-Accessibility-ARYA-

ARYA, which stands for "Assistive Real-time Yarn for Accessibility," is an innovative project designed to break down communication barriers for individuals with speech and hearing impairments. The project utilizes advanced technology embedded in a smart glove to seamlessly translate sign language into text and speech.

The glove incorporates flex sensors and accelerometers strategically placed on each finger, allowing precise tracking of hand gestures. These sensors capture the intricate movements of sign language, ensuring accurate and real-time interpretation. To enhance gesture differentiation, a clever use of a metallic strip has been integrated.

Powered by an Arduino Nano microcontroller, ARYA processes the sensor data efficiently. The inclusion of a Bluetooth module facilitates wireless communication between the glove and an Android phone. The Android interface serves as a dynamic display, presenting the translated text and delivering it through voice output.

ARYA's mission is to provide a user-friendly and portable solution for individuals facing challenges in conventional communication methods. By offering a bridge between sign language and mainstream communication, ARYA aims to empower speech and hearing-impaired individuals, fostering inclusivity and understanding in diverse social interactions.
